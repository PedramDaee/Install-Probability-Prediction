# Ad Install Probability Prediction

This repository contains the IPython Notebook for a data analysis task that I implemented in a short amount of time. 
The notebook is self explanatory. You can either open the .ipynb to be able to play with the code or directly open the .html version.
The data is not provided as I do not have the rights.

The notebook goes through a typical data analysis workflow and has two main sections:

* The data: description of the data and feature engineering methods used. 
 
* The model: description of the preprocessing and modelling decisions.
