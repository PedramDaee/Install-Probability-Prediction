    "It would be crucially important for the core reommendation task to have a feature representation for campains. Unfortunately, it seems that Unity does not have these information. I can think of two ways to do this: (i) try to generate features from the campain itself (e.g., from the textual description of the campain or the video).(ii) generate features for campain based on the interaction data (e.g., if two users installed a couple of similiar campains, then the information about one user can be generalized to the other one for the recommendation). It seems that approach (i) has not been successful. However, it should be possible to exploit the interaction data in (ii). For this, I would need to have a unique user ID to be able to create the sparse matrix of campaignId vs. user_id, where the elements indicate install or no-install event. I could then use matrix factorization and try to estimate this big matrix with two simpler matrix (e.g., AV), and learn these simpler (low dimensional) matrices by minimizing the reconstruction error. I would then be able to use rows of A as a feature representation for campains.   \n",
